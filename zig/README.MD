Each day contains the solutions for parts 1 and 2, along with their tests.
Running `zig build run` won't tell you anything useful.
Instead run `zig build test` to check your answers.
Each part, contained in `src/root.zig`, is accompanied by two tests:
one to test the sample input from Advent of Code,
the other to test your personal input and answer.

you will need to provide your own puzzle input and answer.
Put your puzzle input in `src/input.txt`,
and your answer in `src/part1answer.txt ` and `src/part2answer.txt`.
If you don't know your answers yet, you will still need to provide answer files for the solutions to compile,
but you can provide bogus answers.
The failing tests will tell you the correct answer.
Assuming that answer is accepted by Advent of Code,
you can go ahead and modify your answer file so the tests pass.
